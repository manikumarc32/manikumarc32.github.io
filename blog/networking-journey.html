    <h1>What Networking Taught Me as an Entry-Level Graduate in the UK</h1>
    <p>
      A reflection on attending networking events, building confidence,
      and completing my Master’s degree in Engineering Management.

    <p>
      In March 2025, I attended my first professional networking event in the UK.
      At that point, I was still finding my footing — having completed my studies
      and beginning to understand how professional conversations and opportunities
      work outside the classroom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The event was brief for me, but the interactions were meaningful. Speaking
      with experienced professionals helped me realise that networking is not
      about asking for opportunities immediately, but about listening, learning,
      and building genuine connections over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Attending the event for a second time felt very different. I was more confident,
      more comfortable starting conversations, and more aware of how to communicate
      my background clearly. Small changes — such as how I introduced myself and
      how I listened — made a noticeable difference.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most valuable lessons I learned through these experiences was the
      importance of consistency. Showing up, staying open to feedback, and maintaining
      contact matters more than one-off conversations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Around the same time, I completed my Master’s degree in Engineering Management
      at the University of Greenwich. Graduating marked the end of a significant
      academic chapter and the beginning of a more practical, responsibility-driven
      phase of my career.
    </p>

    <p>
      Completing my degree on time while adapting to a new country and system was
      an important personal milestone. It reinforced the value of persistence,
      structure, and long-term commitment.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an entry-level graduate, I am still learning and growing. Networking has
      helped me build confidence, improve communication, and better understand
      where I can contribute while continuing to develop my skills.
