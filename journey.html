    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <p>
      This page explains my academic and professional journey so far — from my engineering
      education in India to completing my master’s degree in the UK, and my current focus
      on building a strong foundation for an entry-level career.
    </p>

  <!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
  <section>
    <div class="date">2018 – 2022 · India</div>
    <h2>Bachelor’s in Aeronautical Engineering</h2>

    <p>
      I began my higher education in India, where I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in
      Aeronautical Engineering at Sathyabama University. These four years helped me build
      a strong technical mindset and discipline required for engineering work.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my final year, I worked on an academic project involving the development of
      a 2U Nano Satellite for atmospheric sensing. The project was completed as part of a
      team and focused on understanding system integration, hardware components, and
      collaborative problem-solving.
    </p>

    <p>
      This phase of my life shaped my work ethic, teamwork skills, and ability to handle
      long-term academic responsibilities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
  <section>
    <div class="date">2023 – 2025 · United Kingdom</div>
    <h2>Master’s in Engineering Management</h2>

    <p>
      After completing my undergraduate degree, I moved to the United Kingdom to pursue
      a Master’s degree in Engineering Management at the University of Greenwich.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program introduced me to management principles, operations thinking, and
      process-focused problem-solving, complementing my engineering background.
    </p>

    <p>
      For my dissertation, I researched <strong>ethical considerations in the use of AI
      in healthcare research</strong>. This work helped me develop critical thinking,
      structured research skills, and an appreciation for responsibility when applying
      technology in real-world contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I completed my master’s degree on time while adapting to a new academic system
      and living environment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
  <section>
    <div class="date">2025 – Present</div>
    <h2>Transition & Skill Building</h2>

    <p>
      After completing my studies, I began focusing on understanding practical
      operations and logistics environments. I gained hands-on exposure through
      warehouse and logistics roles in the UK, which helped me understand how systems
      work on the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside work experience, I started building foundational knowledge in
      supply chain management, inventory control, SAP ERP systems, and basic data
      analysis concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently continuing to learn and improve, with the goal of securing an
      entry-level role where I can grow responsibly, contribute consistently, and
      develop long-term professional skills.
