    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <p>
      This page shares my journey so far — from completing my education,
      moving to the UK, building responsibility through work and study,
      and gradually developing clarity about my career direction.
      I am at an entry level, learning step by step, and this page reflects that progress honestly.

  <!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
  <section>
    <div class="date">2018 – 2022 · India</div>
    <h2>Engineering Foundation</h2>

    <p>
      I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Aeronautical Engineering at
      Sathyabama University in India. These four years helped me develop
      discipline, technical thinking, and the ability to work consistently
      toward long-term goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of my final-year academic work, I participated in a team-based
      project involving the development of a 2U Nano Satellite for atmospheric
      sensing. The project helped me understand system-level thinking,
      collaboration, and responsibility within a group environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      During this phase, I also took part in workshops and technical activities,
      which contributed to my interest in understanding how real systems are
      designed, built, and managed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
  <section>
    <div class="date">2023 – 2025 · United Kingdom</div>
    <h2>Master’s in Engineering Management & Personal Growth</h2>

    <p>
      In 2023, I moved to the United Kingdom to pursue a Master’s degree in
      Engineering Management at the University of Greenwich. This transition
      was a major step in my life, both academically and personally.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program helped me develop an understanding of operations, planning,
      coordination, and process-focused thinking. It complemented my engineering
      background by introducing management perspectives relevant to real-world
      environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      For my dissertation, I worked on a research topic titled
      <strong>“Ethical Considerations on the Use of AI in Healthcare Research.”</strong>
      This experience strengthened my research skills and helped me understand
      the importance of responsibility, ethics, and accountability when applying
      technology in sensitive domains.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside my studies, I adapted to a new education system, cultural
      environment, and independent living. I completed my master’s degree
      on time, which was an important personal achievement for me.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
  <section>
    <div class="date">2025 – Present</div>
    <h2>Professional Growth, Networking & Skill Building</h2>

    <p>
      After completing my master’s degree, I focused on gaining practical
      exposure and understanding how operations function in real working
      environments. I worked in warehouse and logistics roles, which gave me
      first-hand experience with order flow, accuracy, teamwork, and
      responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      During this period, I also started attending networking events in the UK.
      These events helped me improve my communication, understand industry
      expectations, and gain confidence in interacting with professionals from
      different backgrounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      To strengthen my foundational knowledge, I completed several professional
      certifications focused on supply chain, inventory management, and ERP
      systems. These courses helped me understand concepts beyond daily tasks
      and gave me a structured way to learn.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      I am currently continuing to learn and improve, with the goal of building
      a strong foundation for an entry-level role where I can take responsibility,
      support teams effectively, and grow professionally over time.
